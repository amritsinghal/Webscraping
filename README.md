# Web Scraping

The Concept for this program was to help the students who normally have the list of vocabulary words but lack with meaning's, example's, synonym's, antonym's and translation to most preferred language (by the user).

So, just open the scraper.py using python and run the code.

Requirement's :
    
- The words list should be in **.txt** or **.csv** file with first word as **Words** (we prefer you to use text file).

- State the path where the output docx file should be saved (acc to the rule stated below).

- For any doubt's please do check the sample folder before proceeding.

**Web Scrapping is neither legal nor illegal.**

**Using Web Scrapping for academic purpose doesn't commits towards criminal offensiveness.**

**Some Websites thinks Web Scrapping on their website is illegal while some allows it.**

**We use lexico.com (powered by Oxford University) as the website for web scraping. The Results matches with the Google Results with efficiency of 100%.**

**Don't ever try Web Scraping on Google.**

**Your program may lead to unexpected error's due to Google ReCaptcha Program.**

**Sample Files are placed in the sample folder.**

**Antonym's and Translation is yet to be implemented. And soon will be updated.**

**```Make sure that the path(location) must have two backslashes(\\) after every folder (e.g: D:\\vocabulary.docx). Else file will be saved at default path i.e C:\vocabulary.docx```**

```Location of data file :```

```D:\\Webscraping\\sample\\test.txt```

```Location to store the docx file (editable) :```

```D:\\Webscraping\\sample\\words.docx```

```Your desired file will be saved at : ```
